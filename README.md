# Sign-to-Text-Translation-Tool
The project uses computer vision and machine learning to translate sign language gestures into text, MediaPipe detects handprints, and Random Forest Classifier predicts characters in real time. It recognizes all 26 letters of the English alphabet, providing an intuitive interface to improve communication for people who need to use sign language.
